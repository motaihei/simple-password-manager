# Implementation Log: Fix Delete Button Functionality

## Date and Time
2025-06-24

## Features Implemented
Fixed non-responsive delete button in the password manager application.

## Files Modified
- `renderer.js` - Updated event handling for all action buttons

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Event Delegation**: Replaced inline `onclick` handlers with event delegation pattern to avoid Content Security Policy issues and improve maintainability.
2. **Data Attributes**: Used `data-action` and `data-id` attributes to identify button actions and target password entries.
3. **Removed Window Scope**: Changed function declarations from `window.functionName` to regular function declarations for cleaner code.

## Issues Encountered and Solutions
**Issue**: Delete button (and other action buttons) were not responding to clicks.

**Root Cause**: The inline `onclick` handlers in dynamically generated HTML were likely being blocked by Electron's Content Security Policy, which restricts inline JavaScript execution for security reasons.

**Solution**: Implemented event delegation pattern:
- Added a single event listener on the parent `passwordList` element
- Used `data-action` attributes to identify which action to perform
- Used `data-id` attributes to identify which password entry to act on
- Removed all inline `onclick` handlers from the HTML template

## Code Changes Summary
1. Modified `renderPasswordList()` to use data attributes instead of onclick handlers
2. Added event delegation listener for all table button clicks
3. Converted window-scoped functions to regular function declarations
